# Simple Console Library Management
This is a simple console library management application, which is a project in our "programming techniques" subject.
It is two-man project. We use linkedlist, binary file and basic algorithm.

Originally, the code is Vietnamese, i tried to translate it into English so you may see weird output and weird words (my english is not really good), it's still Vietnamese data though.

In my point of view, my code is suck. It can run with really small database because every data will be loaded onto RAM. We couldn't optimize the code then. I want to share this with other students, it may be useful for someone and hopefully have a few suggestion that i can use for my future project.

Thank you.
